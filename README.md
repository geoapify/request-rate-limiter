# request-rate-limiter

**A lightweight, zero-dependency Node.js library for managing and controlling API request rates with features like progress signaling and batch result retrieval**

The library designed to manage API request rates, prevent 429 "Too Many Requests" errors, and ensure compliance with rate limits for services like [Geocoding APIs](https://www.geoapify.com/geocoding-api/). It helps:

* **Prevent 429 Errors**: The library helps you avoid hitting rate limits that result in "Too Many Requests" (HTTP 429) errors by throttling the number of API calls made within a specific time interval.

* **Manage High Volumes of API Requests**: When handling large amounts of requests (e.g., Geocoding, weather, or payment APIs), the library ensures requests are executed in an orderly and rate-compliant manner.

* **Queue and Batch Requests**: It efficiently queues and batches requests that exceed rate limits, processing them when allowed by the serverâ€™s rate limit, so your application can avoid disruptions or delays.

* **Track Request Progress**: The library provides progress signaling and batch completion callbacks, allowing developers to monitor the status of API calls and handle results in manageable groups.

## Importing the Library
You can import the `@geoapify/request-rate-limiter` library into your project via Node.js or directly in the browser using a CDN.

### In Node.js

If you're using Node.js, install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install @geoapify/request-rate-limiter
```

Then, import it in your code:

#### ESM
For projects using ECMAScript Modules (ESM), you can import the library using the import syntax:
```javascript
import RequestRateLimiter from '@geoapify/request-rate-limiter';
```

#### CommonJS
If you are using the CommonJS module system (Node.js default), you can import the library like this:
```javascript
const RequestRateLimiter = require('@geoapify/request-rate-limiter');
```

## In HTML (Browser) using CDN
You can also use the library in the browser by loading it via a CDN:

Using unpkg:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@geoapify/request-rate-limiter"></script>
```

Using Cloudflare CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/@geoapify/request-rate-limiter/latest/request-rate-limiter.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage
The library exposes a single core function: `RequestRateLimiter.rateLimitedRequests()`. This function allows you to control the rate at which a list of promise-based API requests is executed.

```javascript
RequestRateLimiter.rateLimitedRequests(requests, maxRequests, interval, options);
```

* **requests**: An array of functions that return promises (e.g., API requests) or another result.
* **maxRequests**: The maximum number of requests that can be executed within the specified interval.
* **interval**: The time interval (in milliseconds) within which the maxRequests are allowed.
* **options**: An optional object to provide additional configurations:
    * **batchSize** [optional]: Defines the size of batches for result retrieval. If set, results are returned in batches.
    * **onProgress** [optional]: A callback function to signal progress. Receives an object with `completedRequests` and `totalRequests`.
    * **onBatchComplete** [optional]: A callback function invoked when a batch is completed, providing batch results.

## Return Value

The function returns a promise that resolves once all requests have been processed. 

If the `batchSize` and `onBatchComplete` options are provided, additionally, batch results are returned as each batch is processed.

## Code samples
Here's an example of how to use the @geoapify/request-rate-limiter library to control API requests and see the results in batches:

### Example 1: Basic Usage with Logging
This example demonstrates a simple scenario where six functions are executed with rate limiting, batching, and progress logging.

```javascript
const RequestRateLimiter = require('@geoapify/request-rate-limiter');

const requests = [
    () => { console.log("One"); return 1; },
    () => { console.log("Two"); return 2; },
    () => { console.log("Three"); return 3; },
    () => { console.log("Four"); return 4; },
    () => { console.log("Five"); return 5; },
    () => { console.log("Six"); return 6; }
];

const options = {
    batchSize: 2, // Process two requests at a time
    onProgress: (progress) => console.log(`Progress: ${progress.completedRequests}/${progress.totalRequests} completed`),
    onBatchComplete: (batch) => console.log('Batch completed:', batch)
};

RequestRateLimiter.rateLimitedRequests(requests, 1, 1000, options)
  .then(results => console.log('All results:', results))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error processing requests:', error));
```

In this example, six functions (acting as mock API requests) are processed using the `@geoapify/request-rate-limiter` library. The requests are rate-limited to **one request every second** and are **grouped into batches of two**, as specified by batchSize: 2. 

Every time two requests are completed, the `onBatchComplete` callback is invoked, returning the results of those two processed requests. This setup allows for real-time tracking of progress and batch results, ensuring that requests are handled efficiently and within rate limits.

### Example2: Geocoding Addresses and Saving Results in Batches

This code sample demonstrates how to use the request-rate-limiter library to handle a large number of geocoding requests efficiently by reading a list of addresses from a file, sending them to the [Geoapify Geocoding API](https://www.geoapify.com/geocoding-api/), and saving the results in batches.

* It reads a list of addresses from a file and sends them to the Geoapify Geocoding API using `@geoapify/request-rate-limiter`. 
* It processes the requests in batches, with a maximum of 5 requests per second, and saves the results every 1000 requests into separate JSON files. 
* [Optionally] Once all requests are completed, the full results are saved in a final JSON file.


```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import RequestRateLimiter  from '@geoapify/request-rate-limiter';

// Read addresses from a file
const addresses = fs.readFileSync('addresses.txt', 'utf8').split('\n').filter(address => !!address);

const GEOCODING_API_URL = 'https://api.geoapify.com/v1/geocode/search?limit=1&format=json';
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Function to create geocoding requests
const createGeocodingRequest = (address) => {
    return async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`${GEOCODING_API_URL}&text=${encodeURIComponent(address)}&apiKey=${API_KEY}`);
      if (!response.ok) {
        return { address, error: `Failed to fetch for ${address}: ${response.statusText}`} 
      }
      const data = await response.json();

      if (data.results.length) {
        // get the first resilt
        return { address, result: data.results[0] };
      } else {
        return { address, error: `Address is not found` };
      }
    };
  };

// Prepare an array of request functions for the rate limiter
const requests = addresses.map((address) => createGeocodingRequest(address));

// Batch saving function
const saveBatchResults = (batch) => {
  const filename = `geocode_results_batch_from_${batch.startIndex}_to_${batch.stopIndex}.json`;
  fs.writeFileSync(filename, JSON.stringify(batch.results, null, 2));
  console.log(`Batch from ${batch.startIndex} to ${batch.stopIndex} saved as ${filename}`);
};

// Configure options for request-rate-limiter
const options = {
  batchSize: 1000, // Save results after every 1000 requests
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${progress.completedRequests}/${progress.totalRequests} completed`);
  },
  onBatchComplete: (batch) => {
    console.log(`Batch of ${batch.results.length} requests completed.`);
    saveBatchResults(batch);
  }
};

// Use the request-rate-limiter to send API requests with rate limiting
RequestRateLimiter.rateLimitedRequests(requests, 5, 1000, options)
  .then((allResults) => {
    const filename = `geocode_results_all.json`;
    fs.writeFileSync(filename, JSON.stringify(allResults, null, 2));
    console.log('All requests completed.');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error processing requests:', error);
  });
```
